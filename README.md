# Strange Personas

This is the second web page I developed. This is actually an execrise I did during the course "The Complete Web Developer in 2023: Zero to Mastery" by Andrei Neagoie.
This website was developed using React.js and put online through GitHub Pages.
You can see the final results clicking here ➡️ https://parmedio.github.io/strange_personas/ ⬅️
