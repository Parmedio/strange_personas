# Strange Personas

This is the second web page I developed. This is actually an execrise I did during the course "The Complete Web Developer in 2023: Zero to Mastery" by Andrei Neagoie.\n
This website was developed using React.js and put online through GitHub Pages.\n
Lesson's focus were on learning the basic of React framework, getting and manipulating data from external database, changing the DOM according to user's input.\n
The page hasn't a real utility, in fact, users can only filter by name among ten puppet profile.\n
